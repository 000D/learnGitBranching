2013 Things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tree layout with the layout engine provided in d3.js, that white-paper algorithm. Only tricky thing is that merge commits mess up the "tree" aspect and it doesn't directly support weighting, but I can probably throw that in.
Would require mixing both algorthims and probably some real time dedication
