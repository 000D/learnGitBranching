closures on animations with those snapshots
integrate animation into all git commands

animation factory? stuff like:

-highlightCommit(50, 'targetColor') // during search
-clearHighlightsAllNodes


ALSO other big things:
- Division in their rings based on how many / what branches they are part of
- Color on branch edges??

Big Graphic things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- colored branch edges. basically 
- node rings, really think we should do it
- When you are rebasing and you hit the bottom, all the nodes go in the wrong spot...
          We need some kind of "update everything but this set of nodes" thing...
- averaging colors!


Medium things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Rebuilding trees from a JSON snapshot / blob. this should be easy... i think. if we remove the need for parents
- sizing on visedge arrowheads, also fill most likely


Small things to implement:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Bugs to fix:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
