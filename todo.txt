closures on animations with those snapshots
integrate animation into all git commands

animation factory? stuff like:

-highlightCommit(50, 'targetColor') // during search
-clearHighlightsAllNodes

Big Graphic things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When you are rebasing and you hit the bottom, all the nodes go in the wrong spot...

- animateSnapshotFromTo(), then animate specific nodes


Medium things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Rebuilding trees from a JSON snapshot / blob. this should be easy... i think. if we remove the need for parents
- sizing on visedge arrowheads, also fill most likely


Small things to implement:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minor Bugs to fix:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Big Bugs to fix:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - resolve core ID from alt Id's (C4''' becomes C4), and then skip those commits when rebasing. big
