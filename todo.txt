closures on animations with those snapshots
integrate animation into all git commands

animation factory? stuff like:

-highlightCommit(50, 'targetColor') // during search
-clearHighlightsAllNodes


ALSO other big things:
- Division in their rings based on how many / what branches they are part of
- Color on branch edges??

- sizing on visedge arrowheads, also fill most likely

Big Graphic things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- colored branch edges. basically 
- node rings, really think we should do it


Medium things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Rebuilding trees from a JSON snapshot / blob. this should be easy... i think. if we remove the need for parents


Small things to implement:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Git show
- Git show when you click on a node (or the text technically)


Bugs to fix:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When you are rebasing and you hit the bottom, all the nodes go in the wrong spot...
          We need some kind of "update everything but this set of nodes" thing...

- cannot checkout commits with dashes

- when generating new ids (C1' or C2''), need to check if they already exist!!! otherwise it wil barf
- always grab the maxHeight
- debug why typing takes so long with the profiler
