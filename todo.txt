The Tree.Snapshot() idea

closures on animations with those snapshots

integrate animation into all git commands

animation factory? stuff like:

-commitBirthAnimation(snapshotBefore, snapshotAfter, commit)
-highlightCommit(50, 'targetColor') // during search
-clearHighlightsAllNodes


ALSO other big things:

- Text on commit nodes
- Division in their rings based on how many / what branches they are part of
- Color on branch edges??

- sizing on visedge arrowheads, also fill most likely.
