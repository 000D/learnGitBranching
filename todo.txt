Big things:

- Interactive rebasing :OOOO


Big Graphic things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- gitVisuals OVERHAUL. Will make the load / save tree easier

Medium things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Rebuilding trees from a JSON snapshot / blob. this should be easy... i think. if we remove the need for parents
- gitEngine loads from tree immediately, not the weird thing we have now

Small things to implement:

yeah forces moving it to the commit you indicate
which is impossible as far as I can tell, short of detaching, deleting the branch, and doing branch [name] [commit]
(detach in case that's the branch you're currently on)
checkout -B [name] [commit] is equivalent to branch -f [name] [commit] and then checkout [name]
tl;dr "branch" is to "checkout -b" as "branch -f" is to "checkout -B"

seems like "branch -f [name] [commit]" does the following:
git checkout --detach # in case you're on [name]
git branch -D [name] # delete
git branch [name] [commit] # move to given commit
git checkout [name] # switch back
