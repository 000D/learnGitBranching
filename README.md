# LearnGitBranching
==================

LearnGitBranching is a pseudo-git sandbox and interactive series of tutorials / challenges to accelerate the understanding of how git commit trees work. It supports a fairly wide range of commands and dynamically visualizes the effects each change has on a commit tree visualization next to the command box:
