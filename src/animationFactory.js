/******************
 * This class is responsible for a lot of the heavy lifting around creating an animation at a certain state in time.
 * The tricky thing is that when a new commit has to be "born," say in the middle of a rebase
 * or something, it must animate out from the parent position to it's birth position.

 * These two positions though may not be where the commit finally ends up. So we actually need to take a snapshot of the tree,
 * store all those positions, take a snapshot of the tree after a layout refresh afterwards, and then animate between those two spots.
 * and then essentially animate the entire tree too.
